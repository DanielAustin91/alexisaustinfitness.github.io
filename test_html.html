		<h2>About me</h2>
		
		<p><h5>Before we get into things, I'm sure you have some questions about who I am and what makes me think I know what I'm talking about. Well, for starters I've earned my certification for personal training through ACE - I have the paperwork. I've also been focused on healthy living and proper nutrition for a few years on my own and this is where I've learned my food guidance.</h5></p>
